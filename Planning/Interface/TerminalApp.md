To allow the user to interact with the database, I opted to build a simple CLI style app. I had toyed with the idea of building a GUI, but wasn't satisfied that the options available to me would add any extra value to the project in the time I had available. I also looked at TUI solutions that might have been better for displaying the structured account data. Ultimately I decided that what was most important was demonstrating an understanding of control flow, and thus opted to stick to a very simple ui, printing messages to the console and letting the user input a number of pre-defined commands. I was still able to provide some quality of life, by allowing the user to print a list of valid commands for a given application state.

The actual terminal interface is managed mostly through the `TerminalSession` class. Which is responsible for managing the application loop, log-in state, and provides functions for interacting with the `Database`.
I think it could have been broken down further (it is a fairly long file at ~200 lines), maybe seperating the loop and state management out to new classes. Ultimately though, it is still pretty readable and I am happy with the result.
Initially `TerminalSession` was also responsible for parsing user input, but I refactored all user input related code into a helper class: `InputHelper`.
